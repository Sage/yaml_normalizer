YAML is a file format that's human-readable and very common among Ruby projects.
The [YAML standard](http://yaml.org/) is well-defined and supported by many
programming languages. Ruby's default YAML parser and emitter is
[Psych](https://github.com/ruby/psych#psych).

Yaml Normalizer follows the notion that there is a normalized YAML file
format. It re-formats YAML files in a way that the results closely match Psych's
output. Yaml Normalizer ensures that the original file and the resulting
file are identical regarding the resulting Hash from Psych (stable change). The
primary target of this project are i18n YAML files.

Yaml Normalizer provides
* **Alphabetic Ordering**
  * to improve (human-)readability and maintainability,
  * to avoid duplicate keys,
  * to minimize effort when resolving merge conflicts in YAML files
* **Limited Line Length**
  * to improve (human-)readability and maintainability
* **Non-breaking Changes only**
  * to ensure changes do not impact functional parts of the application.
    Yaml Normalizer considers changing the order of YAML file entries as
    non-breaking,
  * to build maximum trust in Yaml Normalizer and its generated YAML files,
  * to avoid the need of manual reviews.

Yaml Normalizer can be used in frameworks like Rails, Sinatra or Cuba, but
it runs stand-alone as well.

## Installation
    $ gem install yaml_normalizer

## Usage
### Use executable files
Yaml Normalizer provides you with two executables: `yaml_normalize` and `yaml_check`.
This is how you run them in your terminal:

    $ yaml_check my_yaml_file.yml
    $ yaml_normalize my_yaml_file.yml

To check the current version of yaml_normalizer type:
   $ yaml_check --version

   or

   $ yaml_normalize -v

To see the help message for yaml_normalizer type:
   $ yaml_check --help

    or

   $ yaml_normalize -h

### Include Yaml Normalizer rake tasks
In your Gemfile, add

      gem 'yaml_normalizer', require: false
In a Rails context, you might want to only add it to `:development` and `:test` groups.

In your Rakefile, add

    require 'yaml_normalizer/rake_task'
    YamlNormalizer::RakeTask.new do |config|
      yamls = Dir['**/*.yml']  # TODO: Select relevant YAML files in your project.
      config.files = yamls
    end

This will give you two additional rake task (`rake -T`)

    rake yaml:check      # Check if configured YAML files are normalized
    rake yaml:normalize  # Normalize configured YAML files


## Development

In order to start developing with Yaml Normalizer you need to install the following dependencies:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version control)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (programming language)
* [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) (package manager for Ruby)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) (dependency manager for RubyGems)

##### Set up Yaml Normalizer
    $ git clone git@github.com:Sage/yaml_normalizer.git
    $ cd yaml_normalizer/
    $ bundle install
    $ rake

#### Generate Documentation
##### Using Yard
    $ bundle exec rake yard
After generating yard documentation, open index.html at doc/ in your browser.

#### Test Implementation
##### Run continuous integration test suite
    $ bundle exec rake
Running this task executes the following tasks: `inch` `rubocop` `ci_flog` `ci_spec` `mutant`

#### Test Documentation using Inch
    $ bundle exec rake inch
This task applies static code analysis to measure documentation quality. Inch also suggests improvements.

##### Run Guard
    $ bundle exec guard
Guard keeps track of file changes and automatically runs the unit tests related to changed files.

##### Run RSpec
    $ bundle exec rake spec
This task runs the full unit test suite based on RSpec.

#### Test Tests using mutant
    $ bundle exec rake mutant

#### Check and Correct static code metrics using Rubocop
    $ bundle exec rake rubocop
    $ bundle exec rake rubocop:auto_correct

#### Run Flog (check complexity)
    $ bundle exec flog -a lib

## Contributing
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at
https://github.com/Sage/yaml_normalizer.

### Engineering Standards
We want to keep engineering standards high and use code reviews and test tools
to help with that. Yaml Normalizer is designed to have no side effects,
especially regarding Ruby Core and Standard Lib implementation. Also, we want to
keep simplecov, rubocop, flog, inch and mutant happy. We will add more details
on PRs if needed.
